# Weed Detection in a Jetson Nano Device

For inference:
```
python3 pipeline_arduino.py
```
Code to deploy Artificial Intelligence algorithm in the Edge to detect weed in the field and spray specific herbicides to longleaf and shortleaf weeds.

This repository will show all steps to create an algorithm and assemble a device to spray herbicides on the field.

It's a complete pipeline to detect, spray herbicides, check it and calibrate. Also there will be another camera to identify and count just the SugarCane plant.
